# Midi Relay Hub

**MIDI over HTTP — simple, powerful, and cross-platform.**

Midi Relay Hub lets you send and receive MIDI messages across a network using JSON-based HTTP requests. Built for church production, automation, and integration with tools like [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion) and [n8n](https://n8n.io).

## Getting Started

### Desktop Application (v3.x)

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/radicaldo/midi-relay-remix/releases)
2. Launch the app
3. MIDI ports are scanned automatically on startup
4. Access the web UI at `http://localhost:4000`

### Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/radicaldo/midi-relay-remix.git
cd midi-relay-remix

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm start
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # With coverage report
```

## API

The HTTP API allows integration with any system that can make HTTP requests.

📘 **[Full API Documentation](./api.md)**

### Quick Examples

**Send a Note On:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/sendmidi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"midiport":"My MIDI Device","midicommand":"noteon","channel":0,"note":60,"velocity":127}'
```

**Get MIDI Ports:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/midi_outputs
curl http://localhost:4000/midi_inputs
```

**View Live Log:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/log
```

## Triggers

Triggers let you react to incoming MIDI messages. When a matching MIDI message is received, the trigger fires an action:

| Action Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `http` | Send HTTP GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE to a URL |
| `midi` | Send a MIDI message to another port |

### Trigger API

```bash
# List all triggers
curl http://localhost:4000/triggers

# Add a trigger
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/trigger/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"midicommand":"noteon","channel":0,"note":60,"actiontype":"http","url":"http://your-webhook.com"}'

# Test a trigger
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/trigger/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"trigger-abc123"}'
```

---

## Profiles

Save and load different trigger configurations:

```bash
# List profiles
curl http://localhost:4000/profiles

# Save current triggers as a profile
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/profiles/save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Sunday Service"}'

# Load a profile
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/profiles/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Sunday Service"}'
```

---

## Configuration

The app stores configuration using `electron-store`. Settings include:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `apiPort` | `4000` | HTTP server port |
| `allowControl` | `true` | Allow sending MIDI via API |
| `logLevel` | `info` | Log verbosity (debug/info/warn/error) |
| `httpTimeout` | `5000` | Timeout for HTTP triggers (ms) |

---

## Integration Examples

### n8n Workflow

1. Create a webhook trigger in n8n
2. Add a trigger in Midi Relay Hub pointing to your n8n webhook URL
3. Incoming MIDI will now trigger your n8n workflow

### Bitfocus Companion

Use the [midi-relay Companion module](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-josephdadams-midi-relay) to send MIDI from Companion buttons.
